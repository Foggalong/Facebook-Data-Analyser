Issue 1
This code was designed to seperate out the event dates but Facebook gives them in an inconsitent
format so the output was similarly inconsistent and difficult to use.

Issue 2
There's a problem where some things (so far I've seen only messages) will be recorded as happening
at a very old date (e.g 1970) which predates Facebook's eistence. So far I've set it to filter out
dates that predate Facebook's creation (February 4, 2004) but in future I will try and set this to
the users account creation.
