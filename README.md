Facebook-Data-Analyser
======================

Analyses the stored profile data that can be downloaded by a Facbeook user. This data has to be first downloaded by you: it isn't done by the program. The program does all analysis locally and your data isn't sent or stored anywhere.

Some of the output data is printed to the terminal and some is sent to R friendly .txt files for analysis which the program then goes on to do.

Current dependencies are
+ Your Facebook data (downloaded, extracted & untouched)
+ Python 3 (for data scraping)
+ R (for analysis)
+ Unix absed system (the main program currently uses bash)
+ pdftk (used for compling analysis into a single report)
